    "Imagine you have a mobile banking app on your smartphone, and you want to check your account balance. When you open the app and request your account balance, the app communicates with your bank's servers through an API. The API allows the app to securely retrieve your account balance information from the bank's database and then displays it to you on your screen. In this case, the API enables your mobile banking app to access and display your account balance without storing the sensitive financial data on your device or having to understand the complex workings of the bank's database\n",

    "Advantages : \n",
    " -  APIs allow different software systems to communicate and work together, making it easier to integrate and use external services or data.\n",
    " \n",
    " - APIs can be reused across multiple applications, saving time and effort by not having to recreate the same functionality from scratch.\n",
    " \n",
    " - They enable developers to leverage pre-existing services and data, reducing development time and costs.\n",
    " \n",
    " - APIs provide a way to scale your application by integrating third-party services or resources as needed.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages : \n",
    " -  Updates or changes to the API can break compatibility with your application, requiring you to adapt and update your code.\n",
    " \n",
    " -  Some APIs are not free and can incur costs, which might become significant when dealing with high usage or premium features.\n",
    " \n",
    " -  Using external APIs can introduce latency or performance issues, depending on the response time of the external service.\n",
    " \n",
    " - APIs may have limitations in terms of the functionality they provide, which can restrict what you can do in your application.\n",
